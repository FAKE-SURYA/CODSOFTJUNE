# 🔐 Project 3: Simple Password Generator

Welcome! This is Project No. 3 from my CodeSoft internship – a **Simple Password Generator** built using Python. The goal of this task was to create a tool that helps users generate strong, random passwords quickly and easily, using basic Python concepts.

## 📌 About the Project

We all know how important strong passwords are, but let’s be honest—thinking them up is a pain. This script takes care of that by generating secure passwords using a mix of:
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters (punctuation)

It's a lightweight, command-line tool that runs smoothly and doesn’t require any external libraries. A perfect little project to get comfortable with Python basics like loops, string handling, and user input.

## 🛠 Features

- User-defined password length
- Includes letters, digits, and special symbols
- Validates input (minimum 4 characters)
- Simple, clean, and readable code
- Beginner-friendly – no complex modules or setup required

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. You run the script.
2. It asks you how long you want your password to be.
3. As long as it’s 4 characters or more, it randomly builds a password using letters, numbers, and symbols.
4. Your new password is printed to the screen.

## 🔧 Requirements

No fancy stuff. Just make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed

The script uses only two built-in modules:
```python
import random
import string
